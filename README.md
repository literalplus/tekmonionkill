tekmonionkill
=============

(Yes, that means "take money on kill". Tell me if you have a better name)

Very simple Spigot plugin that takes a defined amount of (Vault) money from the victim of a player kill (and gives money to the killer)

Idea by @EncryptedCurse.

---------
This project uses Apache Maven for building. If you ~~are not pro enough to~~ don't know how to use it, take this command line:
````bash
$ mvn clean install
````

Or, if you're too lazy to build it yourself but not lazy enough to quit readin after the first paragraph, you can also
get the latest project artifacts from http://ci.nowak-at.net/job/public~TekMoniOnKill/.

Support
-------
In the remote case that you should need any help using this plugin, you can join [#lit on irc.spi.gt](http://irc.spi.gt/iris/?channels=lit)
and patiently wait for help. (i.e. ask your question and then wait for a reply. Don't quit if you don't get one after 
five minutes. It may also help to mention Literallie in your message since that send him a notification if he's awake)
